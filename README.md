# NYPD interactive crimemap

Using open data from NYC Open Data, I create an interactive crime map of NYC. 

Primary features of the map:
- Crime density by offense type and crime premises, down to zipcode level
- Annual aggregates of offenses by borough region

Data sources:
[New York City Police Department complaint data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Historic/qgea-i56i)

[Department of City Planning GIS data for borough boundaries](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Borough-Boundaries/tqmj-j8zm)
